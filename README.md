## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains customer information from a telecom company, including demographics, contract details, billing methods, and churn status. It includes features such as:
- Customer tenure
- Contract type
- Payment method
- Monthly charges
- Demographic data (age, dependent status, etc.)
- Churn indicator (Yes/No)

## Key Findings
- **Customer Tenure:** Customers with 0-12 months tenure had the highest churn rate, whereas those with over 60 months tenure were less likely to leave.
- **Contract Type:** Month-to-month contract customers had the highest churn rate, whereas customers with two-year contracts showed higher retention.
- **Payment Methods:** Customers paying via electronic checks exhibited a significantly higher churn rate compared to those using automated payments.
- **Demographics:** Single customers and senior citizens had higher churn rates than younger customers or those with dependents.
- **Economic Factors:** Higher monthly charges were strongly correlated with increased churn.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalizing numerical features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior
   - Visualizing churn distribution across different features
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features based on existing data
   - Selecting the most relevant features for analysis
4. **Modeling & Prediction**
   - Applying machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identifying actionable business strategies
   - Proposing data-driven customer retention solutions

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd customer-churn-analysis
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the `customer_churn_analysis.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset and view insights.
3. Modify or extend the analysis as needed.

## Results and Insights
The analysis revealed that tenure, contract type, payment method, and monthly charges are significant churn predictors. Customers on month-to-month contracts and electronic check payments are at higher risk of churning, highlighting the need for targeted retention strategies.

## Recommendations
- Offer long-term contract incentives to reduce churn.
- Provide discounts for customers opting for automated payment methods.
- Develop personalized retention campaigns for high-risk customers.
- Reduce price sensitivity by offering tiered pricing models.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement advanced machine learning models for better churn prediction.
- Develop a dashboard for real-time churn monitoring.
- Apply deep learning techniques to improve customer segmentation.
- Integrate customer feedback analysis for sentiment-based insights.
